<p>Iâ€™m an economist based in London working for the UK Financial Conduct Authority.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m interested in embedding good research practice
in quantitative economics work. That includes designing
strong empirical frameworks, using modern statistical methods, 
and following good working practices for data and code.</p>

<h2 id="research-interests">Research Interests</h2>

<p>My work focuses on using rich microdata to understand consumer behaviour and 
policy impacts in financial markets.</p>

<p>In particular, Iâ€™m interested in applying methods and ideas from machine 
learning to econometrics.</p>
