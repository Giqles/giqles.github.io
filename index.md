## About Me

I work as a Research Scientist at Amazon in London. I'm currently leading the engineering side of an Economics and Machine Learning team, where we use statistics, economics, and technology to solve complex economic and causal inference problems.

Previous gigs include: Data Science at Meta, Research and Policy for Consumer Financial Regulation, and Litigation Consulting.
