## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.jpg">

I'm an economist based in London working for the UK Financial Conduct Authority.

I'm interested in embedding good research practice
in quantitative economics work. That includes designing
strong empirical frameworks, using modern statistical methods, 
and following good working practices for data and code.

## Research Interests

My work focuses on using rich microdata to understand consumer behaviour and 
policy impacts in financial markets.

In particular, I'm interested in applying methods and ideas from machine 
learning to econometrics.
